        The Mayans were an ancient civilization that existed from 250 CE to 900 CE.
        They were a huge civilization for that time.
        The Mayan civilization was made up of many cities such as Tikal, Uaxactún, Copán, Bonampak, Dos Pilas, Calakmul, Palenque and Río Bec.
        The mayan cities were located the tropical lowlands of what is now Guatemala.
        They were centered in a geographical block covering all of the Yucatan Peninsula.
        The Mayan civilization finally ended when they conquered the area in the early 16th century.

        A big part of the reason why the Mayans were such a successful society was because of their achievements in agriculture.
        As early as 1500 BCE the Maya had settled in villages and had developed an agriculture based on the cultivation of corn, beans, and squash.
        The Mayans used something called slash and burn agriculture which is where they burn down forests to clear land for planting.
        They used advanced techniques of irrigation and terracing.

        The Mayans were a civilization that were very based on religion.
        Religious centers were the center of their cities.
        They had many temples in their cities where they would worship their gods.
        Their religion was based on a pantheon of nature gods, including those of the Sun, the Moon, rain, and corn.
        The Mayans were thought to be utterly absorbed in their religious and cultural pursuits.

        The mayan population was thought to be around two million at some point.
        This was an extremely large population for the time.
        At its peak, the Mayan civilization consisted of more than 40 cities, each with a population between 5,000 and 50,000 people.
        Human sacrifices and torture were very common in the Mayan civilization as religious rituals.
        They developed a system of hieroglyphic writing and highly sophisticated calendrical and astronomical systems.
        Another one of their great achievements was making paper from the inner bark of wild fig trees and wrote their hieroglyphs on books made from this paper called codices.

        These are the many reasons that the Mayan civilization was such a thriving civilization that was able to last for so many years.
        Their many achievements in agriculture and general living helped them be one of the best civilizations of the time.
